🔍 Data Quality Assessment Report
==================================================

📊 Dataset Overview:
   Total configurations: 480
   GPUs: 2 (A100, V100)
   Applications: 4 (LLAMA, STABLEDIFFUSION, VIT, WHISPER)
   Frequency points: 61

🏃 Run Coverage Analysis:
   Run 2: 480/480 configs (100.0%)
   Run 3: 480/480 configs (100.0%)

📈 Statistical Quality Metrics:
   Mean coefficient of variation: 12.92%
   Maximum coefficient of variation: 103.62%
   High variance configurations: 225/480
   ⚠️  High variability detected - consider more runs

🚨 Outlier Detection:
   Configurations with outlier flags: 10/480
   time_outlier: 10 configurations

💡 Recommendations:
   • High variability detected - consider extending warm-up periods
   • Always exclude first run to avoid cold start effects
   • Use median aggregation for robust statistics
   • Monitor for thermal throttling in long experiments
