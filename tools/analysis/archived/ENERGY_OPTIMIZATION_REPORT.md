- **H100**: 510-1,785 MHz (85 frequency points)

Memory frequencies were maintained at manufacturer default values to isolate core frequency effects. Frequency settings were applied using `nvidia-smi -lgc <frequency>` and verified before each measurement cycle.

### 2.2 Data Collection Methodology

#### 2.2.1 Experimental Protocol
For each GPU-workload-frequency combination, the following standardized protocol was executed:

1. **System Preparation**:
   - GPU thermal state normalized (idle for 30 seconds)
   - Frequency setting applied and verified
   - System memory cleared and workload initialized

2. **Warm-up Phase**:
   - One complete inference pass executed to eliminate cold-start effects
   - GPU state allowed to stabilize

3. **Measurement Phase**:
   - Four consecutive inference iterations executed
   - Continuous power and performance monitoring throughout
   - No interference from other GPU processes

4. **Data Recording**:
   - Application-level timing captured with microsecond precision
   - Power metrics sampled at 50ms intervals via DCGMI
   - Performance validation through multiple timing sources

#### 2.2.2 Instrumentation and Measurement
**Power Monitoring**: NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager Interface (DCGMI) provided comprehensive power monitoring with the following specifications:
- Sampling rate: 50ms (20 Hz)
- Accuracy: ±0.1W
- Metrics: Instantaneous power, average power, peak power
- Validation: Cross-reference with nvidia-smi readings

**Timing Measurement**: Application-level inference timing with hybrid validation:
- Primary source: Application-reported inference time from `.out` files
- Fallback source: Experiment summary logs for session timing
- Precision: Microsecond-level timing resolution
- Validation: Manual inspection of timing consistency across sources

**Performance Monitoring**: Additional metrics captured for validation:
- GPU utilization percentage
- Memory utilization and bandwidth
- Thermal throttling indicators
- Clock speed verification

#### 2.2.3 Data Quality Assurance
**Repetition Strategy**: Minimum 4 runs per configuration yielding 3,889 total measurements across:
- 12 GPU-workload combinations
- ~85 frequency points per combination (varies by GPU)
- 4+ repetitions per frequency point

**Cold-start Handling**: First run at each frequency systematically excluded to eliminate:
- Model loading overhead
- GPU thermal state initialization
- CUDA context creation effects

**Outlier Detection**: Measurements exceeding 3 standard deviations from the median removed using:
- Z-score calculation: |z| = |x - μ| / σ
- Threshold: |z| > 3.0 for exclusion
- Manual validation of flagged measurements

**Quality Validation**: 
- High variation warning for frequencies with σ > 0.1 × mean
- Cross-validation between timing sources
- Thermal throttling detection and baseline adjustment

### 2.3 Analysis Methodology

#### 2.3.1 Statistical Aggregation
Measurements were aggregated by frequency using the following systematic protocol:

```python
For each frequency f:
  1. Group all runs R at frequency f  
  2. Exclude first run (cold-start elimination)
  3. Remove outliers where |z-score| > 3
  4. Calculate mean and standard deviation
  5. Flag high variation (σ > 0.1 × mean)
  6. Recalculate EDP using aggregated values
```

This approach consolidated 3,889 individual measurements into 793 statistically robust frequency points with confidence metrics.

#### 2.3.2 Optimization Algorithm
Optimal frequency selection employed Energy-Delay Product (EDP) minimization:

**Objective Function**:
```
EDP = Energy × ExecutionTime
where:
  Energy = AveragePower × ExecutionTime
  ExecutionTime = End-to-end inference latency
```

**Constraint Application**:
```
Optimal = argmin(EDP) subject to:
  ExecutionTime ≤ FastestTime × 1.05
```

The 5% performance constraint ensures practical deployment viability while allowing for substantial energy optimization.

#### 2.3.3 Dual Baseline Validation
Two complementary baselines were computed for comprehensive evaluation:

**1. Maximum Frequency Baseline (Deployment Context)**:
- Reference point: Manufacturer maximum boost frequency
- Purpose: Energy savings calculation for production deployment
- Interpretation: Real-world energy reduction potential

**2. Fastest Execution Baseline (Performance Guarantee)**:
- Reference point: Empirically fastest configuration (any frequency)
- Purpose: Performance constraint validation
- Interpretation: Ensures no performance regression beyond threshold

This dual approach addresses the observation that maximum frequency often underperforms due to thermal throttling effects.

- **Execution Time (s)**: End-to-end inference latency from application timing
