## File Generation

These files are automatically generated by:
1. `edp_optimizer.py` - Generates the JSON results file
2. `edp_summary_tables.py --csv` - Generates all CSV export files

To regenerate results:
```bash
# Generate fresh optimization results
python edp_optimizer.py -r "../../sample-collection-scripts"

# Generate summary tables and CSV exports  
python edp_summary_tables.py --csv
```
