# Python 3.6 Compatibility Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the `TypeError: unexpected keyword argument 'capture_output'` error that was occurring when running the profiling scripts on Python 3.6.

## Root Cause
The `capture_output` parameter was introduced in Python 3.7, but the cluster environment uses Python 3.6. This caused runtime errors when the profiling scripts tried to execute subprocess commands.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **`sample-collection-scripts/profile.py`**
   - Line 52: Fixed DCGMI version check
   - Line 196-201: Fixed application execution subprocess call

2. **`sample-collection-scripts/profile_smi.py`**
   - Line 54-55: Fixed nvidia-smi validation check
   - Line 266-271: Fixed application execution subprocess call

### Before (Python 3.7+ only):
```python
subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)
```

### After (Python 3.6+ compatible):
```python
subprocess.run(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
```

## Verification
- Both files compile successfully without syntax errors
- Subprocess calls tested and confirmed working with both Python 3.6+ and 3.7+ syntax
- All functionality preserved (output capture, error handling, etc.)

## Impact
This fix ensures that the profiling scripts can run successfully on Python 3.6+ environments, including the cluster's Python 3.6 installation. The scripts should now execute without the subprocess-related runtime errors.

## Next Steps
The codebase is now ready for deployment on the cluster. You can run your profiling jobs using the updated SLURM submit scripts with confidence that the Python 3.6 compatibility issues have been resolved.
